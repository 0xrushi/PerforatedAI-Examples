# PAI-Working-Examples

This repository can be used when working with Perforated Backpropagation<sup>tm</sup> to replicate results, and to see examples of how to add the algorithm to your system.  Each repository contains full code and README's for running an example with the original code as well as the PAI code.  Each README contains our results running the original repository and the results we got when running it with PAI.  Original repositories are linked along with when we checked them out.

SOTAExamples are examples which were state-of-the-art algorithms on the specified dataset at the time we originally worked with them.  otherExamples are examples which display PAI's ability with a particular architecture or data type, but did not start with state-of-the-art algorithms.

General instructions for adding PAI to a system can be found in the [PAI-API](https://github.com/PerforatedAI/PerforatedAI-API) repository.  But the specific examples of where to put each function and how to use the customization functions can be found here to best implement the system into your training program.  Each folder's README contains the specifics of any decisions not included in the PAI-API README.  To see the differences just look for all files ending with PAI.py, and compare them to the files without the "PAI" at the end.
