Examples in this folder the PAI system shows the capacity to improve the model because the training accuracy improves, however if it is in this folder it overfits with these datasets.  Further experimentation is required to test these algorithms with larger datasets to see if the increased training also improves validation and test.  They are included in this repository so that anyone interested in working with them can see a specific example of how to modify a pipeline which uses them to use Perforated Backpropagation<sup>tm</sup>.
